# Harpin AI Overview
Harpin AI improves your identity data pipelines, elevating data quality and delivering enriched identity profiles that your business can rely on.

## The Problem
Organizations have data, and dirty data at that, spread across many disparate systems today.  The reasons for this are plentiful but include selection of purpose-built technologies such as customer data platforms (CDPs), customer relation management (CRM) tools, customer loyalty systems, transactional systems for point of sale (POS) or payment, and so on, duplicative systems obtained through mergers and acquisitions, and legacy systems that were built over time to solve a specific business need.  Even if your company has created data warehouses and data lakes to bring all this data into a single technology, it's still a challenge to get an accurate representation of each customer as there is often no reliable way to link the data across all of these data sets.  You are then unable to find your most loyal customers, identify customers that are at risk of churn, or even get an idea of how many distinct customers you have.  And good luck using all the new ML and AI technologies out there as you will struggle to achieve the desired outcomes if you are training your models with messy data!  This is where harpin AI can help by pre-processing your data through our data quality and identity resolution technologies to provide high quality data organized into identity profiles for use in all of your downstream systems.

# Repository Overview
While the main harpin AI toolkit is primarily offered as a software as a service (SaaS) solution, we wanted to provide more accessible ways for software engineers, data scientists, data engineers, and others who are tasked with solving today's difficult data problems with a way to easily take the harpin AI toolkit for a test drive.  This repository contains materials that will help you evaluate the harpin AI toolkit on your data, in your environment, for maximum security.  That way you can spend your time playing around with our toolkit instead of filling out forms and answering questions from your compliance team.  The following sections highlight the different ways you can run the harpin AI toolkit, with links to step-by-step instructions to get you up and running quickly.

## Docker Image
Download our harpin AI Toolkit Docker image and try out our identity resolution algorithm on your data.  Run the Docker image anywhere you have access to the data and a Docker runtime, in your cloud or on your own workstation.  The harpin AI shell will walk you through the setup and configuration process and have the resolution process running in Docker in no time at all.

Step by step instructions for downloading and running the harpin AI Toolkit Docker image are available [here](???).

## AWS Sagemaker Algorithm
*COMING SOON!!!*

For you data scientists out there using AWS, we are working on a Sagemaker algorithm that will allow you to run the harpin AI toolkit with a single line of Python code in a Jupyter notebook.
