# Harpin AI Overview
Harpin AI improves your identity data pipelines, elevating data quality and delivering enriched identity profiles that your business can rely on.

# Repository Overview
While the main harpin AI toolkit is primarily offered as a software as a service (SaaS) solution, we wanted to provide more accessible ways for software engineers, data scientists, data engineers, and others who are tasked with solving today's difficult data problems with a way to easily take the harpin AI toolkit for a test drive.

## Docker Image
Download our harpin AI Toolkit Docker image and try out our identity resolution algorithm on your data.  Run the Docker image anywhere you have access to the data and a Docker runtime, in your cloud or on your own workstation.  The harpin AI shell will walk you through the setup and configuration process and have the resolution process running in Docker in no time at all.

Step by step instructions for downloading and running the harpin AI Toolkit Docker image are available [here](???).

## AWS Sagemaker Algorithm
*COMING SOON!!!*

For you data scientists out there using AWS, we are working on a Sagemaker algorithm that will allow you to run the harpin AI toolkit with a single line of Python code in a Jupyter notebook.
